TODO

* make config.xml ONLY contain the feature URLs that the test needs,
  add a first test that verifies that all methods can be accessed and dont throw security exceptions (opera currently also requires widget and device for PositionInfo functioanlity)
* start a lot of widgets to see that the runtime can stand this
* write tests for resetting callback using
     delete callback;
  AND
     callback = null;

policy
* generate tests for BLANKET which are a separate widget and have to be run AFTER all other tests had been run, to test that the permission dialog is not shown again even across multiple widget launches
  problem doing that is if we generate a widget that ONLY executes the BLANKET tests again that some dependencies are not met (some tests need to be executed before which dont have BLANKET)
  i tried it and gave up since I dont know a simple solution yet ...

Device
* setRingtone

Excpetion
* throw excpetion and for-in over the props, that doesnt work on H2

AudioPlayer
* play remote media

Widget
* find out how to properly test onWakeUp() and onFocus()
  either doesnt work or tests dont do it right

DeviceInfo
* verify that the returned values are correct, like phoneScreenHeight, phoneManufacturer, etc.


RadioInfo
* how can we test different signal source types for onSignalSourceChange() ?
* how can we explicitly connect to a certain radioSignalSource to check the property's value, see test 300 and 310 (they are just the basic tests, every source value should be testable)


Global
* test exceptions etc. for various different config.xml setups, e.g. has jil NS, has w3c NS, etc.

File
* test delete directories
* test delete dirs with files and without files in them ...
* test dirs that contain dirs too (spec only says "If a directory is given as the target, and it contains any files, the folder will  
not be deleted until it does not contain any files.") talks only abot file :)
* test with non-empty path, test with a dir in a dir


Application
* test start widgets using launchApplication() using the widget:// URL
* add PICTURES with a real image

AccountInfo
* account balance and subscriptiontype, see following comment
// TODO the following ar edisabled for now, since I dont know how we can check if the tests are applicable for the current device,
// actually better for the current operator and SIM card ... maybe untestable?

AddressBook
Possible tests (as defined in the spec., text copied form spec) - FIX by new spec
* If startInx is greater than endInx in PIM_findAddressBookItems function, the returned addressBookItemsFound will be an empty array.
* If startInx is greater than the number of found items in PIM_findAddressBookItems function, the returned addressBookItemsFound will be an empty array.
* If endInx is greater than the number of found items in PIM_findAddressBookItems function, the returned addressBookItemsFound will contain items bwteeen startInx and the last returned item inclusively.
* setAddressGroupNames(groups)
* getAddressBookGroupMembers

Telephony
* see TODOs in the js file
* TODO search in date ranges

VideoPlayer
* fullscreen mode, setWindow 100%

PositionInfo
* make sure the GPS symbol in the top status bar turns off after a while when not in use (seems like it doenst currently)

Camera/VideoCamera
* always needs a setWindow() for the preview ... I dont know if this is right, what does the spec say?
* I think we can use the resulting image/video and show it inside the widget to verify the captured content, try this
* add tests which verifies the length of the video exactly, seems 3s video is only about 2sec long

Messaging
* createMessage/send: huge messages, wrong numbers, invalid recipients, etc.

Config
* setDefaultRingtone, setWallpaper

Calendar
* onCalendarItemAlert

PowerINfo
* onLowBattery
