Sprint 2

Excpetion
* throw excpetion and for-in over the props, that doesnt work on H2

AudioPlayer
* play remote media

Widget
* find out how to properly test onWakeUp() and onFocus()
  either doesnt work or tests dont do it right

DeviceInfo
* verify that the returned values are correct, like phoneScreenHeight, phoneManufacturer, etc.


RadioInfo
* how can we test different signal source types for onSignalSourceChange() ?
* how can we explicitly connect to a certain radioSignalSource to check the property's value, see test 300 and 310 (they are just the basic tests, every source value should be testable)


Global
* test exceptions etc. for various different config.xml setups, e.g. has jil NS, has w3c NS, etc.

File
* test delete directories
* test delete dirs with files and without files in them ...
* test dirs that contain dirs too (spec only says "If a directory is given as the target, and it contains any files, the folder will  
not be deleted until it does not contain any files.") talks only abot file :)

Application
* test start widgets using launchApplication() using the widget:// URL
* add PICTURES with a real image

AccountInfo
* account balance and subscriptiontype, see following comment
// TODO the following ar edisabled for now, since I dont know how we can check if the tests are applicable for the current device,
// actually better for the current operator and SIM card ... maybe untestable?

AddressBook
Possible tests (as defined in the spec., text copied form spec) - FIX by new spec
* If startInx is greater than endInx in PIM_findAddressBookItems function, the returned addressBookItemsFound will be an empty array.
* If startInx is greater than the number of found items in PIM_findAddressBookItems function, the returned addressBookItemsFound will be an empty array.
* If endInx is greater than the number of found items in PIM_findAddressBookItems function, the returned addressBookItemsFound will contain items bwteeen startInx and the last returned item inclusively.
* setAddressGroupNames(groups)
* getAddressBookGroupMembers

Telephony
* see TODOs in the js file
* TODO search in date ranges

VideoPlayer
* fullscreen mode, setWindow 100%

PositionInfo
* make sure the GPS symbol in the top status bar turns off after a while when not in use (seems like it doenst currently)

Camera/VideoCamera
* always needs a setWindow() for the preview ... I dont know if this is right, what does the spec say?
* I think we can use the resulting image/video and show it inside the widget to verify the captured content, try this
* add tests which verifies the length of the video exactly, seems 3s video is only about 2sec long

Messaging
* createMessage/send: huge messages, wrong numbers, invalid recipients, etc.

Config
* setDefaultRingtone, setWallpaper

Calendar
* onCalendarItemAlert

PowerINfo
* onLowBattery
