What is a "jil-dist-signed" widget?
===================================

It is a widget that is properly JIL signed and should be working on every device, that supports signing properly.
It should work without timely limitations (as oppposed to the test-signed widget)
and might also have been pushed to the stores, but that is an
infrastructure topic (actually irrelevant here).
